## What it is 
Inspired by pokemonGO, I have created an augmented reality app which can be used at University of Waterloo Computer Muesuem. When shine the camera on the object that is registered in the system with the app, extra information about the artifacts pop up on the screen. 

## What's the purpose
This has been developed during my time as computer muesum research assistant at University of Waterloo. I made it to increase accessibility of the Muesum. With the interactive app, I believed this will amplify people's interest when they tour different artifacts. 

## What's next
This application needs better UI and additional functions to be actively used in daily practices. Also, the designs need to be touch upon as well. 

For details, please refer to the documentation I made. The link: https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:8106852f-e665-495c-994c-c1cd6c08231c
